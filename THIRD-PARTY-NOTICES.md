# Third-party notices

This file records source incorporated into or adapted by gwnative and
third-party material distributed with the application. Unless a section says
otherwise, modifications made for gwnative are distributed under
GPL-3.0-only. The complete machine-readable path annotations are in

## Sparkle 2.9.4

The macOS application bundle includes a modified-for-packaging copy of
[Sparkle 2.9.4](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases/tag/2.9.4).
The framework is thinned to arm64, unused sandbox XPC services are removed,
and the remaining code is re-signed. Build-machine copies of Sparkle's
`generate_keys` and `sign_update` utilities are also vendored but are not
included in the application.

Sparkle and the third-party components it incorporates are distributed under
the terms reproduced in [`packaging/sparkle/LICENSE`](packaging/sparkle/LICENSE).
That complete notice is copied into every application bundle as
`Contents/Resources/Sparkle-LICENSE.txt`.

## ArenaNet and Guild Wars material

ArenaNet's Guild Wars client, WebAssembly modules, JavaScript glue, game data,
and filesystem image are fetched from ArenaNet at runtime. Full client artifacts
are not part of the repository or release packages and are not licensed by gwnative.
The narrow generated-glue excerpts in [`web/fixtures/`](web/fixtures/README.md)
are pinned test inputs, excluded from the gwnative GPL grant and marked with
`LicenseRef-ArenaNet-Proprietary`. Their source hashes are recorded alongside them.

The application icon in `packaging/icon.png`, its generated
`packaging/AppIcon.icns` copy, `docs/assets/app-icon.png`, and the Guild Wars
login screenshot in `docs/assets/game-login.jpg` contain ArenaNet-owned
artwork. They remain proprietary and are identified by
`LicenseRef-ArenaNet-Proprietary` in the REUSE metadata. See
[`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) for the official-project disclaimer, ownership notice,
and links to ArenaNet's governing terms.
