//! Saved login, held in the login keychain.
//!
//! A generic-password item lets macOS own encryption, permissions and
//! replacement. The ACL is the system's, the item appears in Keychain Access
//! under its own name, and deletion is one keychain operation rather than a
//! filesystem transaction.
//!
//! One item holds both fields, because the client asks for the pair or for
//! neither. The account name is not itself a secret, but splitting it out would
//! mean two items that can disagree.
//!
//! What the ACL actually keys on
//! -----------------------------
//! Worth writing down, because the obvious guesses are all wrong and the cost
//! of guessing is a dialog asking someone for their macOS login password.
//!
//! The item carries a list of the code allowed to open it. An entry is not a
//! path: the same signed program reads its item from anywhere on disk, so
//! moving the application to `/Applications` does not by itself cost anything.
//! Nor is it the binary: a rebuild with an entirely different code hash still
//! reads, which is what lets an update ship without logging everybody out.
//! What an entry pins is the *designated requirement* — for this program,
//! `identifier "com.gwnative.app"` plus the signing certificate. Change either
//! and the item belongs to somebody else, and the system asks.
//!
//! That is one prompt per identity that ever wrote the item, and the list grows
//! rather than replacing. An ad-hoc `cargo build` binary is a fresh identity on
//! every relink, so a development machine collects entries the way this one
//! did, while a signed build — dev or shipped — matches the entry it made.
//!
//! The data-protection keychain has none of this: access is decided by the
//! signing team, so no list and no prompt. It is also unreachable here. It
//! needs the `keychain-access-groups` entitlement, which needs a provisioning
//! profile embedded in the bundle to authorise it; without one `SecItemAdd`
//! returns `errSecMissingEntitlement`, and with the entitlement but no profile
//! macOS kills the process at launch. That profile would have to be issued per
//! App ID and re-issued before it expired, so the Developer ID build that
//! anybody can download and run would acquire an expiry date. Not worth it for
//! one saved password — so this stays on the legacy keychain, and simply never
//! asks. See `never_asks` below.
