//! Quitting and coming back.
//!
//! Two settings — the render scale and the gesture translation — are read once
//! on the way up and cannot change under a running client, so the panel has
//! always saved them and then said "at the next launch". This is that launch,
//! offered rather than left to the player to arrange out of the Dock.
//!
//! The successor has to be started before this process is gone, because the
//! moment it is gone there is nobody left to start it. That leaves the two of
//! them briefly alive at once, on a machine whose whole single-instance rule
//! says they must not be — so the successor is told to wait, and waits on the
//! lock itself rather than on a pid. Waiting on the lock is what makes it
//! correct rather than merely usually right: whatever else happens, the second
//! app runs only once the first has let go, even if some third launch is racing
//! for the same lock.
//!
//! Nothing here quits. Starting the successor can fail — a binary that has been
//! deleted or replaced under the running process, a system refusing to fork —
//! and an app that quits on the strength of a launch that never happened has
//! taken the game away and given nothing back. The caller quits only once this
//! has answered.
