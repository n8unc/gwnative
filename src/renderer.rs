//! What the page is allowed to do, and what happens when it dies.
//!
//! Three jobs, one object, because WebKit asks for all of them through
//! delegates it holds on the same web view.
//!
//! **Navigation.** The page starts at the loopback origin and has no business
//! leaving it. Nothing in `web/` links off-origin, so any navigation that tries
//! to is either the client following something it parsed out of server content
//! or a script that got somewhere it should not have — and in both cases the
//! result of allowing it is the game's window quietly becoming a browser
//! pointed at somebody else's page, with the session token and the injected
//! settings still in the realm it came from. So: same origin or nothing. This
//! sits *underneath* the DNS allowlist in `net`, which governs what the host
//! dials on the client's behalf; this one governs what the window itself
//! becomes.
//!
//! **Recovery.** The web content process is a separate process and it can be
//! killed — by the jetsam pressure that a 4.2 GB streaming game invites, or by
//! a WebGL driver fault. WKWebView does not reload itself when that happens; it
//! leaves a blank white view and no error, which reads exactly like the app
//! hanging. One automatic fresh-process restart turns that into a re-boot the
//! player watches happen. Its marker survives into the successor, so a client
//! that crashes its renderer on every boot stops visibly instead of relaunching
//! forever.
//!
//! **Pointer lock.** Holding the right button rotates the camera, and the page
//! implements that by locking the pointer and integrating `movementX`/`Y` — the
//! only way to keep turning once the cursor reaches the edge of the window.
//!
//! In Safari a page just gets the lock. In a `WKWebView` it does not: the
//! request is routed to the application's UI delegate. WebKit's
//! `UIDelegate::UIClient::requestPointerLock` asks for the private selector
//! `_webViewDidRequestPointerLock:completionHandler:` and otherwise denies
//! the request. A similarly named method is never called. Do not implement
//! `_webViewRequestPointerLock:` alongside it: WebKit prefers that deprecated
//! notification but then unconditionally denies the request.
//! Source: WebKit/Source/WebKit/UIProcess/Cocoa/UIDelegate.mm.
