//! Loopback origin for the harness.
//!
//! The client has to run in a secure context (IndexedDB, crypto.subtle) and the
//! harness wants microsecond timers. A custom WKURLSchemeHandler origin gets the
//! secure context but WebKit clamps `performance.now()` there to 1 ms, which is
//! too coarse for the per-frame telemetry. A loopback origin is trustworthy per
//! spec, is not clamped, and — with COOP/COEP — is cross-origin isolated, so
//! SharedArrayBuffer stays available if the client ever wants threads.
//!
//! Bound to 127.0.0.1 on a fixed port, so nothing is reachable off-host. The
//! port has to be fixed rather than ephemeral because it is part of the origin,
//! and WebKit keys IndexedDB by origin: an ephemeral port gives the page a new,
//! empty store on every launch, so nothing the client writes there — skill
//! templates, settings, chat logs — ever survives a restart.
//!
//! What is served splits cleanly in two, and so does the code. [`api`] holds
//! the `__` routes, which are host capabilities and are gated by a token;
//! [`content`] holds the snapshot, the proxy and the files on disk, which are
//! open because the vendored client asks for them itself. This file is the
//! listener, the connection loop and the one dispatch between the two.
