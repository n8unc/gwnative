//! Sparkle, when it is there.
//!
//! [`crate::release`] can tell a player that something newer exists and open a
//! web page. That is the whole of what it can do, and it is not an update: the
//! player still downloads a disk image, still drags it over the copy that is
//! running, still finds out afterwards what changed. This module is the other
//! half — the framework that reads a signed feed, shows the release notes for
//! the version it found, downloads it in the background and installs it on
//! quit.
//!
//! ## Why it is looked up rather than called
//!
//! Nothing here names a Sparkle symbol. Every call goes through the
//! Objective-C runtime by selector, and every entry point starts by asking
//! whether the class exists at all. That is not caution about the framework; it
//! is a fact about this project's builds. `Contents/Frameworks` only exists in
//! a bundle, and most of what gets run here is not one — `cargo run`, the
//! benchmarks, the test harness. `build.rs` links Sparkle weakly so those still
//! start; this file is what makes them still *work*, by answering "no" and
//! letting [`crate::release`] handle the question the older way.
//!
//! So there are two update paths in this application on purpose, and which one
//! a build takes is decided by whether the framework loaded. They are not
//! alternatives to choose between: the second exists because the first cannot
//! be present in a build that was never packaged.
//!
//! ## Who owns the two switches
//!
//! Sparkle keeps `automaticallyChecksForUpdates` and
//! `automaticallyDownloadsUpdates` in the application's user defaults and says,
//! in as many words, not to keep a second copy — because its own interface
//! changes them. The update window carries an "install automatically in the
//! future" checkbox, and a launch that pushed this profile's values over the
//! top would quietly undo the box the player had just ticked.
//!
//! This project does keep a second copy, in app-global `updates.json`, because the
//! settings panel is a web page and cannot read `NSUserDefaults`. What keeps
//! that honest is the direction of the copy. Sparkle's defaults are the truth;
//! [`start`] reads them and writes the app-global settings to match. The stored
//! preference is pushed
//! the other way in exactly two cases: the first launch after this shipped,
//! where Sparkle has no stored answer and the player's existing app opt-in would
//! otherwise be lost, and [`follow`], which is a player moving the switch in the
//! panel a moment ago. The latter still persists the player's answer when an
//! offline or no-update launch deliberately did not start Sparkle; writing a
//! local default does not schedule or perform a network request. Named profiles
//! overlay this one app-global answer through [`settings::ScopedStore`]; allowing
//! each profile to persist a different value would make two concurrent updater
//! processes race on Sparkle's shared default.
//! Every settlement holds the `updates.json` cross-process lock across both the
//! `NSUserDefaults` operation and the mirror write. [`follow`] dispatches to the
//! main thread before taking that lock, so no file lock is carried across an
//! asynchronous boundary.
//!
//! What is copied is what the player asked for, not what Sparkle will do about
//! it tonight — the two differ, and copying the wrong one silently discards an
//! opt-in. See [`intent`].
