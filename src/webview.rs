/// WebKit feature flags this host turns off because each conflicts with a
/// running game's timing or background-download contract.
///
/// The first is the frame-rate cap: WebKit prefers rendering updates near
/// 60 Hz even on displays that refresh faster, and the game's main loop is
/// `requestAnimationFrame`, so this one flag is the difference between 60 and
/// 120 FPS on a ProMotion display.
///
/// The rest are what happens to a hidden page. WebKit does not merely stop
/// frames for an occluded window — it throttles the page's timers and then
/// suppresses the web content process outright, which freezes networking,
/// the session, everything. Measured twice from a blank install: the boot
/// download stalled mid-flight (at 2,093 and at 1,485 of ~6,000 chunks) the
/// moment the machine went unattended, and never resumed — the harness's
/// timer fallback could not save it, because the process its timers lived in
/// was itself suspended. A player who starts the download and walks away must
/// still come back to a finished install; these flags preserve that contract.
