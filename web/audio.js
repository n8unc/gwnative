// Game audio: capture the client's audio contexts, and give the host a volume
// control it did not otherwise have.
//
// The client is Emscripten OpenAL, not SDL2. Its `AudioContext` is built inside
// the glue's `_alcCreateContext` and kept on a glue-local object that nothing
// exports. `Module.AL` is not a way in either — `AL` is in the glue's
// `unexportedSymbols` list, and reading an unexported symbol off `Module` does
// not return undefined, it calls `abort()` and takes the runtime with it.
//
// So the only safe way to reach the context is to be the thing that constructs
// it. `_alcCreateContext` reads `window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext`
// at call time, which means replacing those globals any time before the glue
// starts playing is enough.
