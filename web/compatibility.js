// What this app can and cannot do against the client build it was handed.
//
// The client is ArenaNet's and it changes without warning. One feature depends
// on recognising the inside of it — saving a build template writes a file, and
// the five routines that do the writing are the ones `src/wasm` patches. On a
// build this release has never been checked against, the patch is not applied
// and the Save button in the template window does nothing at all.
//
// Silence there reads as a broken game. It is not: everything else the client
// does is unaffected, which is the part worth saying in the same breath as the
// part that is missing.
//
// The settings panel says it whenever it is open, beside the affected controls.
// This module also records the transition in diagnostics once per artifact.
// Neither path is allowed to delay the original client.
