// The user guide, in the app.
//
// It could have been a page on the project's website, and that is what the Help
// menu of most applications points at. Two things argue against it here. This
// app is a way of playing a game offline-ish on a laptop, and a Help menu that
// needs the network to answer is one that fails exactly when someone is trying
// to work out why nothing is loading. And the guide is about *this build* — the
// settings it has, the things it does and does not do — so a link to whatever is
// currently published would drift from the copy in front of the player.
//
// The text is data rather than markup for the same reason the settings panel's
// controls are: it is the specification, the tests read it, and adding a section
// takes no other change.
