// The panel behind ⌘, — the only way to reach the settings without a text
// editor.
//
// The host has owned a settings file since the render scale went in, and the
// page has read it at every boot, but nothing has ever offered to change it.
//
// Two of them cannot take effect until the next launch, and the panel says so
// rather than pretending. The render scale is handed to the client through an
// import it reads when it recomputes the canvas, and the gesture translation is
// a set of listeners installed once at boot around a mode that was captured by
// value. Both are fixable — and both are a change to the boot path to fix,
// which is not a change worth making inside a settings panel.
//
// So the panel offers the launch instead. Saying "next launch" and leaving the
// player to arrange one was honest but not much use: the setting they just
// asked for is on disk and inert, and the only thing standing between them and
// it is a quit they have to think of themselves.
//
// The panel is in tabs because it outgrew the window. Eight controls, each with
// a sentence under it, is taller than the game window many people play in — and
// the old layout centred that column in the viewport, which meant the overflow
// went off the top as well as the bottom and the part off the top could not be
// scrolled to at all. The first setting was not merely hard to reach, it was
// unreachable. Tabs keep any one view short enough to fit; the dialog scrolls
// inside itself for the sizes where even that is not enough.
